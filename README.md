## QR Code Generator with Auto Deletion
This project is a Node.js-based CLI application that allows users to generate a QR code for any URL or message, save it as a PNG image, and store the inputted URL/message in a text file. The QR code image is automatically deleted after 10 seconds to ensure space efficiency.
